# Breast Cancer Classification (Neural Network)

This project uses a Neural Network to classify breast cancer as **benign** or **malignant** based on medical data.  
The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and evaluated for accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Project Structure
```
notebooks/  - contains Jupyter notebooks  
src/        - (optional) Python scripts for training/testing  
data/       - dataset (if small, otherwise use external link)  
models/     - saved trained models  
```

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
cd breast-cancer-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/breastcancerclassification(NeuralNetwork)project5.ipynb
```

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt`.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from [UCI ML Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)).

## Results
- Accuracy: ~XX%  
- Precision: ~XX%
